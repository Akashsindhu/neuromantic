# Use cases

## Distributed Neural Networks
- [Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer by Jeff Dean et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538)
  - See [The VU Sound Corpus by Emiel van Miltenburg et al](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/206_Paper.pdf)
- [PathNet: Evolution Channels Gradient Descent in Super Neural Networks by deepmind](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/pathnet-evolution-channels-gradient-descent-super-neural-networks/)

## Sound recognition
- [The VU sound corpus](https://github.com/CrowdTruth/vu-sound-corpus) - annotated sounds based on https://freesound.org/ database
- [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/) - a sound vocabulary and dataset that consists of an expanding ontology of 632 audio event classes and a collection of 2,084,320 human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos

# Tools

## [Google Cloud AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl/)
Pros:
- let users train their own custom machine learning algorithms from scratch, without having to write a single line of code
- uses Transfer Learning (the more data and customers, the better results)
- is fully integrated with other Google Cloud services (Google Cloud Storage to store data, use Cloud ML or Vision API to customize the model etc.)
Cons:
- limited to image recognition (2018-Q1)
- doesn't allow to download a trained model
